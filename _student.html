      <h4>Student Paper Competition</h4>
      <p>
      Any student or new Ph.D. whose degree was awarded after Jan 1, {{info.year-1}}
      is invited to submit a paper to the Student Paper Competition.
      Submissions should be based on work while done as a full-time student;
      results after graduation are not eligible.
      Papers should contain original, unpublished work; however, submissions presenting
      analysis/results taken in part from recently submitted papers under review
      (but not already accepted for publication)
      will be considered. In addition, all papers
      submitted should represent the work and writing of the student submitting
      the paper, developed in collaboration with any named
      advisors/collaborators.  Proofreading and editing by senior contributors
      is allowed, but contributions must be written primarily by the student
      author.

      Student papers must be formatted according to the template provided (below), with no
      changes in margins, font sizes, etc.  Contributions may be at most 10 pages
      long, including all figures and references.  Papers submitted that do not
      follow these requirements will not be considered for the competition.
      </p>

      <p>
      The template and format for the student paper competition are listed at
      <a href="https://github.com/copper-multigrd-conference/student-paper">https://github.com/copper-multigrd-conference/student-paper</a>.
      The template uses the SIAM article class; specific steps to format the
      submission can befound in the README.
      </p>

      <p> Lodging expenses may be awarded (for students currently attending a U.S. university), subject to
      funding.  Student paper winners will have priority.  Students seeking
      support should email the conference coordinator, Annette Anthony
      (annetteFanthony@gmail.com) for more information.  </p>

      <h4>How To Participate</h4>

      <p>
	Student paper submission involves two steps with different deadlines.
      <p>
      <LI> First, you must submit an abstract for the student paper by <b>{{deadlines.studentabs.date}}</b>. Please login to <a href="{{info.submissionlink}}">EasyChair</a> (or create an account if you do not have one), and go to submissions for CM{{info.year}}:
      <br>
      <div class="text-xs-center">
        <a role="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="{{info.submissionlink}}">Submission page</a>
      </div>
      Make sure you click on the Student Paper Competition track.<br>

      <p>
      <LI>Second, you will submit the student paper by <b>{{deadlines.studentpaper.date}}</b>.
      Please visit again <a href="{{info.submissionlink}}">EasyChair</a>, and locate your abstract submission. Then on the upper right corner select "Add a file". This will lead you to a prompt to upload your paper. The paper must be in <b> PDF </b> form. <br>

      <p>
     Note: paper submissions will not be allowed without an abstract submission by the first deadline.
