    <h4>Conference Format</h4>

    <p class="text-justify">
    The 2022 conference will be a <i>virtual</i> conference, entirely online.

    The daily schedule will involve five days of parallel sessions, with around
    four hours of talks.  More details can be found below and on
    the <a href="{{info.programlink}}">program</a> page.
    </p>

    <p>
    In addition to and prior to the technical presentation, the following
    tutorials will be offered this year.
    <ul class=>
      <li>TBD (previous Wed)</li>
      <li>TBD (previous Th)</li>
      <li>TBD (previous Fr)</li>
    </ul>
    Each tutorial will be 2 hours long from 16:00 - 18:00 UTC (9am - 11am PDT,
    12pm - 2pm EDT, 17:00 - 19:00 CET).
    </p>

    <p>
    A <a href="student.html#details">student paper competition</a> is open to
    current and recent students attending the conference.  In addition, a
    <a href="about.html#specialissue">special section</a> devoted to the themes of
    the conference is open to all.
    </p>

    <h4 id="specialissue">Special section devoted to iterative methods</h4>
    <p>
    <b>Special Section Editor:</b> Andreas Stathopoulos
    </p>

    <p>
    As in previous even-numbered years, papers are invited for submission to a special section in the SIAM
    Journal on Scientific Computing.
    This single section will be dedicated to recent progress in iterative
    methods.  Submissions are encouraged in all aspects of iterative methods,
    including this year's <a href="about.html#topics">highlighted topics</a>.
    Attendees and participants of the conference as well as the general community
    are invited to submit papers.  The papers should meet the formatting and
    editorial requirements of SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing.
    </p>

    <p>
    Submissions for the special issue will be accepted from
    {{deadlines.specialissueopen.date }} until
    <b>{{deadlines.specialissue.date}}</b>.  Papers will be subject to review
    by a guest Editorial Board.  Submissions should be made using the ordinary
    submission process at <a href="http://sisc.siam.org">
    http://sisc.siam.org</a>,  with a statement in the cover letter requesting
    that the paper be considered for the special issue.  In addition, the "Copper
    Mountain Special Section 2022" should be selected in the Special Section
    dropdown.  <center><a href="http://sisc.siam.org"> <img style="border:2px"
