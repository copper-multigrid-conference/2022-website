Another significant advantage is that it enables using batched linear algebra kernels to achieve high performance on GPUs. Consider the solution of linear systems as an example.

In any distributed, network-connected system today, either large or small, computers of various types are present throughout the system, leading to “edge computing” as an increasingly important paradigm. Often these edge devices are low-powered, inexpensive, and unreliable, either due to harsh physical conditions, the threat of cyber intrusions, or simple cost considerations. Collaborative Autonomy is an emerging class of computational techniques and software that enables these edge devices to self-organize and work together as a collective, without the presence of a single central master computer, to solve computational problems and make decisions. A key principle of Collaborative Autonomy is the focus on inherent algorithmic resilience, so that the collective system can adapt around problems in the computational environment, such as hardware malfunctions, network failures, and cyber intrusions. This algorithmic resilience aims  to ensure the system as a whole has a high degree of reliability even when no devices do individually.</p><p>In this edge computing setting, numerical problems are often best solved through iterative, possibly asynchronous, methods. In this talk, we will present the Skynet software under development at LLNL and its novel approach to enabling algorithmic resilience for decentralized iterative methods. Specifically, Skynet focuses on providing a suite of resilient variants of algorithmic “building blocks,” such as reduce and averaging methods, that are widespread across iterative algorithms. By implementing an iterative method using this building-block interface, a user can often achieve algorithmic resilience to problems in the computational environment “for free” with little-to-no additional implementation or algorithm design work. We will present a number of common algorithmic building blocks supported by the Skynet software and will show experiments demonstrating the impact of making these building blocks resilient.</p><p>Funded by LLNL LDRD projects 21-FS-007 and 22-ERD-045.

The block version of GMRES (BGMRES) is most advantageous over the single right hand side (RHS) counterpart when the cost of communication is high while the cost of floating point operations is not. This is the case on modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), while it is generally not the case on traditional Central Processing Units (CPUs). In this talk, experiments on both GPUs and CPUs are shown that compare the performance of BGMRES against GMRES as the number of RHS increases. The experiments indicate that there are many cases in which BGMRES is slower than GMRES on CPUs, but faster on GPUs. Furthermore, when varying the number of RHS on the GPU, there is an optimal number of RHS where BGMRES is clearly most advantageous over GMRES. A computational model is developed using hardware specific parameters, showing qualitatively where this optimal number of RHS is, and this model also helps explain the phenomena observed in the experiments.</p></div></td></tr></table></div><div class="session"><a name="session:58825"><div class="heading"><span class="interval">09:00-11:05</span> <span class="title">Session 11B: Computational Electromagnetic  and Transport Systems</span></div></a><div class="session_chair"><div class="chair_word">Chair: </div><div class="chair_names"><a href="person149.html" class="person">John Shadid</a></div></div><table class="talks"><tr class="talk"><td class="time">09:00</td><td><a name="talk:187931"><div class="authors"><a href="person130.html" class="person">Marlis Hochbruck</a>, <a href="person131.html" class="person">Jonas Koehler</a> and <a class="person" href="person132.html">Pratik Mahadeo Kumbhar</a></div></a><div class="title">Preconditioning for linear systems arising in implicit time integration schemes for Maxwell equations on locally refined spatial grids</div><div class="presenter">PRESENTER: <a href="person132.html" class="person">Pratik Mahadeo Kumbhar</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT.

Mesoscopic heat transfer models are based on the nonlinear Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) for phonons. The phonon BTE is an integro-differential equation for a multidimensional single-particle distribution function that depends on the position, phonon frequency, direction of motion, phonon polarization, and time. We consider steady-state models with the single-mode relaxation-time (SMRT) approximation for the collision integral of the phonon BTE. The discretization of the phonon BTE leads to a very large system of nonlinear equations which requires efficient iteration methods.</p><p>In this study we apply a linearization approach, borrowed from proven and frequently utilized methods for thermal radiation transport problems in high-energy density physics, to iteratively solve non-linear temperature-and-frequency dependent phonon transport problems – simulating heat transport at the microscale. The resulting phonon intensities are consistent with the material temperature. The linearization approach requires iteration on both the pseudo-scattering source (as an inner iteration) and the material temperature (as an outer iteration). Numerical investigations have revealed that the iterative performance significantly degrades as the acoustic thickness of the problem increases. As expected, the unaccelerated inner pseudo-scattering iterations were inefficient due to the purely scattering nature of the problems. The outer material temperature iterations, based on a Newton’s method approach, became extremely inefficient as well. A gray diffusion synthetic acceleration (DSA) methodology was applied to accelerate the convergence rate of the pseudo-scattering source iterations. Gray DSA method was found to be highly beneficial at reducing the number of inner iterations required per temperature iteration. To address the slow convergence on the outer material temperature iteration result, an Anderson acceleration (AA) scheme was employed. The obtained results showed that the AA scheme reduces the number of material temperature iterations required to reach convergence by about a factor of two. By combining both the Gray DSA and AA, we have been able to demonstrate reductions in the computational time required by a factor of 60 – 130. These findings highlight a major difference in the linearization method’s performance compared to that previously demonstrated in thermal radiation transport problems. An important distinction between these two physics is the phonon mean-free-path’s dependence on temperature. As temperature increases, the phonon mean-free-path generally decreases whereas in thermal radiation transport the photon mean-free-path increases. We argue that this is the primary reason for the difference in observed iterative efficiency when these acceleration techniques are applied to phonon and thermal radiation transport. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed iteration method, we will present numerical results for multi-group phonon transport problems.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">09:50</td><td><a name="talk:187970"><div class="authors"><a class="person" href="person41.html">Hengbin An</a> and <a href="person42.html" class="person">Xiaowei Jia</a></div></a><div class="title">On constructing a physics-based initial iterate for solving drift-diffusion equations</div><div class="presenter">PRESENTER: <a href="person41.html" class="person">Hengbin An</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. The drift-diffusion equations are a class of nonlinear systems in the application of semiconductor devices. High efficient solution methods for solving these equations play a significant role in numerical simulations. Some nonlinear iterative methods, including Newton method and Gummel method, are usually used to solve the discretized drift-diffusion equations. Therefore, a nonlinear initial iterate should be given. The nonlinear initial iterate has a strong influence on the solution method. Typically, the related physical values in the equilibrium state, including the potential, the electron concentration, and the hole concentration, are used as the initial iterate for solving the equations with a given bias voltage. Due to the strong nonlinearity, by using the typical initial iterate, the nonlinear iterative methods converge slowly or even diverge when the given bias voltage is large. In this paper, an efficient initial iterate is constructed by exploiting the application features of the drift-diffusion equations. The key idea is to construct an approximate equation of the drift-diffusion equations by neglecting the recombination effect and casting the effects of the bias voltage on carriers' quasi-Fermi potential. And the initial iterate is obtained by solving the approximate equation. Some physical interpretations and theoretical analyses for the proposed method are given. Numerical results show that the proposed initial iterate is effective, and the number of nonlinear iterations can be reduced by about 90\% at most compared to the typical initial iterate. In some cases, the nonlinear iteration does not converge when the typical initial iterate is used, while the iteration converges if the new initial iterate is used.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">10:15</td><td><a name="talk:187977"><div class="authors"><a class="person" href="person29.html">Siobhan Correnty</a>, <a href="person30.html" class="person">Elias Jarlebring</a> and <a class="person" href="person31.html">Kirk Soodhalter</a></div></a><div class="title">Flexible infinite GMRES for parameterized linear systems</div><div class="presenter">PRESENTER: <a href="person29.html" class="person">Siobhan Correnty</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. We consider parameterized linear systems $A(\mu) x(\mu) = b$ for many different $\mu$, where $A(\mu)$ is large, sparse and nonsingular, with a nonlinear analytic dependence on $\mu$. In this work we propose to compute a partial parameterization $\tilde{x} \approx x(\mu)$, where $\tilde{x}(\mu)$ is cheap to evaluate for many values of $\mu$. Our method is based on a companion linearization (without truncation) where $\mu$ appears only linearly. This allows us to combine the well-established Krylov subspace method for linear systems, preconditioned GMRES, with algorithms for nonlinear eigenvalue problems (NEPs) to generate a basis for the Krylov subspace. Moreover, in this work we consider a flexible framework for GMRES, allowing for an inexact iteration dependent application of the preconditioner. This novel approach leads to a significant improvement in complexity over the method infinite GMRES, as proposed in [Jarlebring, Correnty 2021].

Iterative methods play an integral part in science, not least as a way of approximating the solutions to implicit discretizations of physical models. Frequently, the success of such discretizations relies on the ability to preserve physical invariants such as mass, momentum, energy and/or entropy. While this serves as a design principle for discretizations of partial differential equations, iterative methods are typically not designed based on such ideas. </p><p>In this talk we consider the application of iterative methods in the context of hyperbolic conservation laws, and in particular fluid flow models. We focus on the question whether iterative methods conserve mass, both globally and locally, and what implications mass conservation has on the convergence of the iterations. As it turns out, many commonly used methods are able to preserve the global conservation of an underlying implicit scheme. This includes pseudo-time iterations, Newton's method, Krylov subspace methods etc. However, there are prominent exceptions, in particular the Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel iterations.</p><p>The stronger requirement on the discretization of local conservation is a critical ingredient in the important Lax-Wendroff theorem, which expresses conditions under which the limit of a convergent discretization is a weak solution of the conservation law. We show that local conservation is preserved by pseudo-time iterations, Krylov subspace methods and Newton’s method, under certain restrictions on the space-time discretization. Further, we present an extension of the Lax-Wendroff theorem that incorporates pseudo-time iterations. The proof reveals that the resulting method in general is inconsistent, unless special care is taken in the choice of pseudo-time steps. This inconsistency materializes in the form of slowed down time.</p><p>A simple technique based on the explicit Euler method can alleviate the inconsistency introduced by the pseudo-time iterations. Further, the same technique can be used to generate improved initial guesses for other iterative methods. We explore the technique in the context of Newton and Newton-Krylov methods to gain new insights into the role of consistency and convergence for iterative  methods.</p></div></td></tr></table></div><div class="session"><a name="session:58826"><div class="heading"><span class="interval">09:00-11:05</span> <span class="title">Session 11C: Iterative Solution in Fluid Flow Applications</span></div></a><div class="session_chair"><div class="chair_word">Chair: </div><div class="chair_names"><a class="person" href="person1.html">Stephen Thomas</a></div></div><table class="talks"><tr class="talk"><td class="time">09:00</td><td><a name="talk:187980"><div class="authors"><a href="person25.html" class="person">Yuhsuan Shih</a></div></a><div class="title">AMG-preconditioned primal-dual Newton-Krylov solvers for viscous-plastic sea-ice models</div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT.

However, direct triangular solves are comparatively slow on GPUs. 
Previous work by Chow and Patel (2015) and 
Antz et al. (2015) proposed an iterative approach to solve these systems.
Unfortunately, when the Jacobi iteration is applied to highly non-normal 
upper or lower triangular factors, the iterations will diverge.  
An ILU smoother is introduced for classical
Ruge-Stuben C-AMG that applies row and/or column 
scaling to mitigate the non-normality of the

Jacobi iteration in place of the inherently sequential triangular solve. 
Because the scaling is applied to the upper
triangular factor as opposed to the global matrix, it can be done
locally on an MPI-rank for a diagonal block of the global matrix.  
Numerical results and parallel performance are presented for 
the Nalu-Wind pressure continuity and PeleLM nodal projection

Xu et al (2021), that iteratively solves the Schur system

We consider the problem of estimating parameters of physical transport phenomena from available observations. Physical transport is a combination of two types of transport: a) advection, a process where the transport of a substance or quantity is driven by a motion of a fluid; and b) diffusion, a process where the transport of a substance or quantity is driven by a macroscopic movement of molecules due to Brownian motion. Our goal is to estimate a vector field representing a fluid velocity flow, referred to as advection coefficient, and a scalar field representing isotropic diffusive processes, referred to as diffusion coefficient. We note that in this work, we are concerned only with the case of stationary advection and diffusion coefficients.</p><p>There are two approaches for the mathematical description of physical transport which, consequently, define the two types of observations that we deal with. The first approach, known as Eulerian approach, assumes a fixed physical domain and describes a dynamics of substance quantity, e.g., concentration, in each point of time and space due to transport. Such dynamics is defined by a non-stationary advection-diffusion partial differential equation (PDE). The second approach, known as Lagrangian approach, assumes a substance is comprised of a large number of particles and describes a dynamics of particle-trajectories over time due to transport. Such dynamics of individual particles is described by a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE). Measurements of a spatiotemporal function describing the concentration of a given substance are referred to as spatial observations, while measurements of temporal functions describing trajectories of particles are referred to as point-wise observations.</p><p>Typically, a parameter estimation problem is solved by searching for a set of parameters that minimize a data misfit functional. Such functional represents a discrepancy between observations and a forward solution of a transport equation obtained with searched parameters. However, this minimization problem is challenging to solve, as it involves computation of gradients and/or Hessians. Another difficulty is that the aforementioned problem does not necessarily have a unique solution. For instance, if a time-aggregated support of spatial observations does not cover the problem domain completely then the advection cannot be determined with certainty in the unobserved area. To overcome this, additional assumptions, such as prior information about the structure of the advection and diffusion parameters, are necessary. While such information is application specific, commonly used assumptions are minimum energy and smoothness of the desired estimates.</p><p>To solve the parameter estimation problem, we propose to reformulate it as a state estimation problem for the unknown advection and diffusion coefficients. In this setting, the state estimation problem is represented with a chosen synthetic model encapsulating prior knowledge and plays a similar role to regularization. A good choice of such synthetic model is the Helmholtz equation which provides a balance between smoothness and energy constraints. Furthermore, the synthetic model has an unknown but bounded additive term representing a level of error in the model. The observations equations are given by the advection-diffusion PDE, and/or Lagrangian ODEs, and are also additionally equipped with unknown but bounded additive terms representing a level of observation error.</p><p>To find a solution of the state estimation problem, we first discretize it in space using Petrov-Galerkin approximations and the Finite Element Method (FEM). We also note that the Lagrange ODEs are rewritten as spatiotemporal equations each weighted by a particular Dirac's delta function. We then construct a minimax smoother which minimizes the worst case scenario for all possible realizations of model and observations errors. To this end, the problem gets represented as a coupled system of a forward and adjoint equations for the unknown state and Lagrange multiplier, respectively. The resulting system has a block structure of sparse matrices and it is solved by an iterative method. We note that this sparse structure has an advantage over other solvers like the gradient descent method; the proposed algorithm solves a single linear system iteratively as opposed to refining the solution over several iterations of gradient descent, each of which relies on linear solvers of their own.</p><p>Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed method on two numerical simulations. In both cases, the observations are generated synthetically and the method is used to recover the original PDE coefficients. For the first test, we run a simulation of the advection-diffusion equation, and in the second case we focus on the advection equation together with a set of Lagrange advection ODEs. In the second simulation, we only estimate the advection coefficient. We present results in terms of the error with respect to the ground truth coefficients under different levels of refinement.</p></div></td></tr></table></div><div class="session"><div class="coffeebreak"><span class="interval">11:05-11:30</span><span class="title">End of Day Break</span></div></div></div>
