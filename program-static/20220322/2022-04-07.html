Multigrid reduction in time (MGRIT) is an optimal, scalable, multilevel parallel in time algorithm that has been shown to achieve significant speedup vs. sequential time stepping on massively parallel CPU machines. This speedup is attained through the use of additional computational resources and only occurs after a "cross-over point" where sufficient parallel resources are concurrently used. This talk examines how the move to GPU architectures impacts speedup, the crossover point, and the best choice of parallel decomposition of the space-time domain for MGRIT compared to CPU architectures.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">09:25</td><td><a name="talk:187918"><div class="authors"><a href="person159.html" class="person">Ahsan Ali</a>, <a href="person160.html" class="person">James J.

Hyperbolic PDEs, which arise from many important applications, remain a challenging problem for AMG, because the resulting linear systems are highly non-symmetric. AMG for such problems is typically hard because the traditional coarsening, interpolation and relaxation strategies designed for symmetric positive definite systems can break down. Additionally, effective AMG for hyperbolic problems would provide a parallel-in-time solver in this area of traditional difficulty.  It has been observed that for space-time advection-diffusion problems, classical AMG, as well as nonlinear variants of AMG such as local approximate ideal restriction, can suffer from slow convergence and instability issues. In this work, we develop an adaptive-like method which can transition continuously from AIR for advective problems to a more classical AMG approach for diffusive. The goal is a robust solver which addresses various space-time advection-diffusion problems including purely advective, purely diffusive and the advection-diffusion mixed regime.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">09:50</td><td><a name="talk:187967"><div class="authors"><a class="person" href="person47.html">Oliver Krzysik</a>, <a href="person48.html" class="person">Hans De Sterck</a> and <a class="person" href="person49.html">Robert Falgout</a></div></a><div class="title">Fast multigrid reduction-in-time for linear advection</div><div class="presenter">PRESENTER: <a class="person" href="person47.html">Oliver Krzysik</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. Many iterative parallel-in-time algorithms have been shown highly efficient for diffusion-dominated partial differential equations (PDEs), but often are inefficient or even divergent when applied to advection-dominated PDEs. We consider the application of the iterative two-level Parareal algorithm, and its multilevel generalization of multigrid reduction-in-time (MGRIT) to linear advection PDEs. The key to efficient time integration with these methods is using a coarse-grid operator that provides a sufficiently accurate approximation to the the so-called ideal coarse-grid operator. For certain classes of semi-Lagrangian discretization, we present a novel semi-Lagrangian-like coarse-grid operator that leads to fast multilevel time integration of linear advection PDEs. The operator is composed of a semi-Lagrangian discretization followed by a correction term, with the correction designed so that the leading-order truncation error of the composite operator is approximately equal to that of the ideal coarse-grid operator. Parallel results show speed-ups over sequential time integration for variable-wave-speed advection problems using high-order discretizations.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">10:15</td><td><a name="talk:187960"><div class="authors"><a class="person" href="person64.html">Santolo Leveque</a> and <a href="person65.html" class="person">John Pearson</a></div></a><div class="title">Parameter-Robust Preconditioning for Oseen Iteration Applied to Navier-Stokes Control Problems</div><div class="presenter">PRESENTER: <a href="person64.html" class="person">Santolo Leveque</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT.

A framework is presented to design multirate time stepping algorithms for two dissipative models with coupling across a physical interface.  The coupling takes the form of boundary conditions imposed on the interface relating the solution variables for both models to each other.  The multirate aspect arises when numerical time integration is performed with different time step sizes for the component models.  We describe a unified approach to develop multirate algorithms for these problems. This effort is pursued though the use of  discontinuous-Galerkin time stepping methods, acting as a general unified framework, with different time step sizes.  The two models are coupled across user-defined intervals of time, called {\it coupling windows}, using polynomials
that are continuous on the window.  The coupling method is shown to reproduce the correct interfacial energy dissipation, discrete conservation of fluxes, and asymptotic accuracy.  Also, the method could provide a limit for the total communication needed between components, independent of the number of time steps on a coupling window.  In principle, methods of arbitrary order are possible.  As a preliminary step, we focus on the presentation and analysis of monolithic methods for advection-diffusion models coupled via generalized Robin-type conditions. The monolithic methods could be computed using a Schur-complement approach, or by Schwarz-type iteration.  We also discuss some 
recent progress for partitioned algorithms and different types of coupling conditions.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">09:50</td><td><a name="talk:187938"><div class="authors"><a class="person" href="person117.html">Michael Gaiewski</a> and <a href="person108.html" class="person">Chad Sockwell</a></div></a><div class="title">Air-Sea Light: Coupling a Simple Ocean-Atmosphere Model</div><div class="presenter">PRESENTER: <a class="person" href="person117.html">Michael Gaiewski</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT.

Partitioned methods for coupled problems permit independent solution for each constituent component, allowing for the reuse of existing single-component codes. Thus, partitioned methods can shorten code development and validation times for multiphysics and multiscale applications. This efficiency can be further increased by allowing at least one of the “codes” to be a projection based reduced order model (ROM). We simulate this scenario by considering a model interface problem that is discretized independently on two non-overlapping subdomains. On one of the subdomains, a ROM is constructed by performing proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) on a snapshot ensemble to obtain a low-dimensional reduced order basis, followed by a Galerkin projection onto this basis. This ROM is then coupled to either a traditional finite element model (FEM), or to a separate ROM constructed on the other subdomain, through a Lagrange multiplier representing the interface flux. The flux can be expressed as the solution of a Schur complement system stemming from the monolithic coupled problem. Application of an explicit time integration scheme at this juncture effectively decouples the subdomains, allowing for their independent solution at each time step. We present numerical results which show the method’s efficacy in achieving accurate ROM-FEM and ROM-ROM coupled solutions while decreasing the required computational time.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">10:40</td><td><a name="talk:187904"><div class="authors"><a href="person108.html" class="person">Chad Sockwell</a>, <a class="person" href="person75.html">Kara Peterson</a>, <a href="person74.html" class="person">Paul Kuberry</a> and <a href="person195.html" class="person">Pavel Bochev</a></div></a><div class="title">Interface Flux Recovery Framework for Constructing Partitioned Heterogeneous Time-Integration Methods</div><div class="presenter">PRESENTER: <a class="person" href="person108.html">Chad Sockwell</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. Coupling schemes serve as the glue which holds multi-physics simulations together and are ideally efficient, stable, and conservative in terms of flux. A common approach for partitioned schemes wishing to employ different time integrators to different subproblems is to lag the coupling terms in time. This can lead to accuracy issues, especially in multistage methods. In this talk, we present a novel framework for partitioned heterogeneous time-integration methods, which allows the coupling of arbitrary multistage methods without reducing their order of accuracy. The core idea of our approach is to effect the splitting through an auxiliary monolithic system, which is used to construct a polynomial-in-time approximation of the interface flux. The latter allows each subproblem to be solved independently at every time-step.  Our framework differs from other approaches in that it allows a flexible choice of underlying time-integrators for the individual subproblems without compromising the time-accuracy at the coupled problem level. We demonstrate the method on a  model problem representing a proxy of the tracer transport component in air-sea couplings in earth system models. We report numerical tests evaluating accuracy and flux conservation for different pairs of time-integrators in the explicit Runge-Kutta and Adams-Moulton families.</p></div></td></tr></table></div><div class="session"><a name="session:58823"><div class="heading"><span class="interval">09:00-11:05</span> <span class="title">Session 9C: Preconditioning</span></div></a><div class="session_chair"><div class="chair_word">Chair: </div><div class="chair_names"><a class="person" href="person198.html">Ron Morgan</a></div></div><table class="talks"><tr class="talk"><td class="time">09:00</td><td><a name="talk:187902"><div class="authors"><a href="person198.html" class="person">Ron Morgan</a> and <a href="person199.html" class="person">Joel Henningsen</a></div></a><div class="title">Polynomial Approximation to the Inverse of a Matrix</div><div class="presenter">PRESENTER: <a class="person" href="person198.html">Ron Morgan</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT.

We have recently extended the geometric multigrid infrastructure of the open-source finite element library deal.II [1,2] with global coarsening multigrid features [3-5] in addition to the existing local smoothing multigrid functionalities [6]. These two geometric multigrid variants differ in the way how they define multigrid levels. While local smoothing uses all cells on a given refinement level for this definition, global coarsening obtains the levels by recursively globally coarsening the finer levels.</p><p>In this presentation, we will compare in a fair and unbiased way the advantages and disadvantages of global coarsening and local smoothing algorithms from implementation and performance points of view for equivalent smoothers and on state-of-the-art CPU hardware. To our knowledge, this has not been done in the literature yet, since most projects only have implemented one of these approaches. The experiments are conducted in the setting of the current state of the art for higher-order finite element methods with matrix-free operator evaluation as the main computational kernel.</p><p>We will present serial simulations as well as parallel weak and strong scaling on up to 147,456 CPU cores on the SuperMUC-NG supercomputer. Preliminary results indicate that global coarsening algorithms have a better parallel behavior for comparable smoothers due to their additional flexibility in load balancing. In the serial case, the high costs of applying hanging-node constraints in comparison to highly efficient matrix-free kernel evaluations might be a dominating factor, leading to advantages of local smoothing, which per construction ignores hanging-node constraints during smoothing, even though the number of solver iterations is typically slightly higher.</p><p>In addition, we will show how a well-designed global coarsening implementation is extendable to (global) polynomial coarsening, also known as p-multigrid, for locally refined meshes and high-order FEM. The combination of such a p-multigrid solver, AMG and one of the geometric multigrid solvers described above allows to construct hybrid multigrid solvers [7] for locally refined meshes both for continuous and discontinuous Galerkin discretizations. Such a hybrid multigrid solver is used in the incompressible Navier-Stokes solver ExaDG [8] to solve the pressure Poisson problem on non-trivial coarse grids, e.g., of a lung geometry [9], with moderate number of refinement levels and moderate polynomial degrees. We will share our experiences made during the application of the new global-coarsening infrastructure and the hybrid multigrid solver built around it to real-world problems, particularly regarding the requirements posed to other parts of the code, which were not an issue previously when local smoothing was used.</p><p>References</p><p>[1] Arndt, D., Bangerth, W., Davydov, D., Heister, T., Heltai, L., Kronbichler, M., Maier, M., Pelteret, J.P., Turcksin, B. and Wells, D., 2021.

Multilevel low-rank tensor approximation has been rigorously analyzed for certain classes of functions solving elliptic second-order PDEs in up to three dimensions. These include, in particular, analytic functions, solutions with algebraic corner singularities and highly-oscillatory solutions to multiscale diffusion problems. In these settings, multilevel low-rank tensor methods have been shown to admit exponentially convergent approximations and hence to be comparable in efficiency to such techniques as spectral and hp approximations and multiscale FE approximation.</p><p>The approximation power of tensor methods is based on the successive adaptive approximation in suitable low-dimensional subspaces, typically realized by the matrix SVD. In the case of multilevel representation, that amounts to the adaptive computation of low-parametric effective discretizations within extravagantly large but generic finite-element spaces. The use of low-rank tensor representation for these background finite-element spaces allows, in principle, refining them until the meshwidth reaches the level of machine precision if necessary. Computational algorithms exploiting such approximations are data-driven in the sense that the effective discretizations are adapted to the data and are constructed in the course of computation, not being confined by design to any specific bases (such as polynomial or piecewise-polynomial bases). However, in three dimensions, the complexity of solvers based on low-rank tensor refinement becomes prohibitively large when one pursues stability and convergence in the energy norm (for example, by employing rigorous preconditioning techniques).</p><p>In this contribution, we revisit a BPX-type preconditioning technique developed recently for multilevel low-rank tensor methods and present a novel algorithm for applying the preconditioner.

The Scheduled Relaxation Jacobi (SRJ) method is a linear solver algorithm which greatly improves the convergence of the Jacobi iteration through the use of judiciously chosen relaxation factors (an SRJ scheme) which attenuate the solution error. Schemes have primarily been developed to accelerate the solution of elliptic PDEs (e.g. Poisson's equation) in the literature. The goal of this paper is to develop a methodology for constructing SRJ schemes which are suitable for solving non-elliptic PDEs (or equivalently, the nonsymmetric linear systems arising from the discretization of such PDEs). These schemes are obtained by numerically solving a constrained minimization problem which guarantees the solution error will not grow as long as the Jacobi iteration matrix associated with the linear system has eigenvalues which lie in certain elliptical regions of the complex plane. We demonstrate that these schemes accelerate the convergence of standard Jacobi iteration when solving the nonsymmetric linear systems arising from discretization of the 2D steady advection-diffusion equation.</p></div></td></tr></table></div><div class="session"><div class="coffeebreak"><span class="interval">11:05-11:25</span><span class="title">Coffee Break</span></div></div><div class="session"><a name="session:58819"><div class="heading"><span class="interval">11:25-13:30</span> <span class="title">Session 10A: Discretizations and Impact on Iterative Solution</span></div></a><div class="session_chair"><div class="chair_word">Chair: </div><div class="chair_names"><a href="person149.html" class="person">John Shadid</a></div></div><table class="talks"><tr class="talk"><td class="time">11:25</td><td><a name="talk:187884"><div class="authors"><a href="person239.html" class="person">Adeleke O Bankole</a>, <a class="person" href="person240.html">Jeremy L Thompson</a> and <a class="person" href="person241.html">Jed Brown</a></div></a><div class="title">Looking beyond polynomial bases for wave propagation with finite elements</div><div class="presenter">PRESENTER: <a class="person" href="person239.html">Adeleke O Bankole</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. The eﬀiciency of matrix-free operator application improves with polynomial degree up to about degree 7 and is remarkably stable beyond. The use of very high degree in wave propagation is moderated by two related factors: the Runge effect leads to small time steps and polynomials have relatively poor resolving power near the centers of elements. This can be observed by noting that the Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre points cluster quadratically toward the ends of the unit interval, and thus the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) criteria scales with h/p^2 . We explore a nonpolynomial basis and quadrature based on analytic conformal mappings proposed by Hale and Trefethen [2] that offer more uniform resolution with carefully designed regions of analyticity mapped from the ellipsoids associated with Gauss quadrature. We extend the local Fourier analysis toolkit [3, 4] to investigate the dispersion properties and impact on the CFL criteria. We also provide numerical examples to explore the accuracy and performance relative to polynomial bases for linear and nonlinear wave propagation problems using libCEED [1].</p><p>References

Multilevel methods can be efficient and robust preconditioners for Krylov subspace methods for solving linear systems that arise from discretizing elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs). Geometric multilevel methods typically use grid-based restriction and interpolation operators to reduce the size of the linear system that has to be solved and accelerate the convergence. In this work, we remove grid dependence by developing new meshfree restriction/interpolation operators based on radial basis functions (RBF) methods and combine these with a meshfree coarsening strategy. We apply these methods as a solver and preconditioner in a V-cycle iteration to meshfree discretizations of elliptic PDEs on surfaces. The meshfree methods utilized in this work are RBF finite differences (RBF-FD) and generalized finite difference (GFD). Results on scaling and convergence rates of the new meshfree multilevel method with different parameter choices are displayed.

The current application of CMFD only has a linear convergence rate. The AA method is similar to a quasi-Newton and can improve the convergence rate of the fixed-point iterations. We implement the AA for the 2D calculation in MPACT. The initial results show that the AA method can improve the convergence rate in a trivial problem, and reduce the number of transport outer iterations and the runtime in practical problems.

In this talk, we propose  three novel block-structured multigrid relaxation schemes based on distributive relaxation,  Braess-Sarazin relaxation, and Uzawa
relaxation, for solving the Stokes equations discretized by the mark-and-cell scheme. In our earlier work, we  discussed these three types of relaxation schemes, where the weighted Jacobi iteration  is used for inventing the Laplacian involved in the Stokes equations. In \cite{he2018local}, we show that  the optimal smoothing factor is  $\frac{3}{5}$  for  distributive weighted-Jacobi relaxation and  inexact Braess-Sarazin relaxation,  and  is $\sqrt{\frac{3}{5}}$ for $\sigma$-Uzawa relaxation.  Here, we propose mass-based approximation inside of these three relaxations, where mass matrix $Q$ obtained from  bilinear finite element method is  directly used to approximate to the inverse of  scalar Laplacian operator instead of using Jacobi iteration. Using local Fourier analysis, we  theoretically derive the optimal smoothing factors for the resulting three relaxation schemes.  Specifically,  mass-based  distributive relaxation,  mass-based  Braess-Sarazin  relaxation, and mass-based $\sigma$-Uzawa relaxation have  optimal smoothing factor $\frac{1}{3}$, $\frac{1}{3}$ and  $\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}$, respectively.  Note that the mass-based relaxation schemes do  not cost more than the original ones using Jacobi iteration. Another superiority  is that there is no need to compute the  inverse of a matrix.

Convection-diffusion equations arise in a variety of applications such as particle transport, electromagnetics, and magnetohydrodynamics. Simulation of the convection-dominated case, even with high-fidelity techniques, is particularly challenging due to sharp boundary layers and shocks causing jumps and discontinuities in the solution, and numerical issues such as loss of the maximum principle in the discretization. These complications cause instabilities, admitting large oscillations in the numerical solutions when using traditional methods. Drawing connections to the simplex-averaged finite element method (S.

High-order finite element methods are widely perceived to be too expensive for most engineering analysis due to the cost of residual assembly per degree of freedom (dof). Moreover, the Jacobian of a non-linear operator rapidly loses the sparsity and the number of nonzero entries per dof grows with $p^d$ as the order $p$ of basis function increases in $d$ dimension, which necessitate matrix-free implementation for more efficient finite element simulation. A matrix-free approach yields better performance, both in terms of storage and solve time over matrix-based approaches when higher order discretizations are utilized. Due to ill-conditioning of the elliptic problem, preconditioning is required to ensure the fast convergence of iterative solvers. One of the large class of preconditioners is based on multigrid methods. Geometric multigrid methods are common preconditioner for elliptic partial differential equations. $H$-multigrid, which is the typical type of geometric multigrid used for low-order discretizations, coarsens the mesh by aggregating multiple elements. However, with unstructured meshes aggregating fine grid elements to form the coarse grid representation can be somewhat complex. $P$-multigrid, which coarsens the mesh by reducing the order of the basis functions on each element, can be a more natural preconditioner for unstructured meshes with high-order elements. Another multigrid preconditioner is Algebraic multigrid (AMG) where the restriction operators are constructed algebraically without requiring any mesh information. These methods use only information of the matrix sparsity and its entries of the assembled operators which discards the performance benefits of using a matrix-free representation for high-order implementation. Therefore, we use geometric multigrid with $p$ coarsening and utilizing AMG as the coarse grid solver along with a Chebyshev polynomial smoother in each multigrid cycle. In contrast to $h$-multigrid, each level in $p$-multigrid is related to a different approximation polynomial order $p$, instead of the element size $h$. We investigate a matrix-free high-order finite element discretization with Newton-Krylov iterative solvers and $p$-multigrid preconditioning for the hyperelasticity problem at finite strain on unstructured 3D meshes in parallel. Domain decomposition, parallel assembly, and communication over all processors are performed by employing the parallel computing library PETSc and the discretized matrix-free operator is evaluated in libCEED. libCEED is a library that offers a purely algebraic approach with a run-time selection of implementations tuned for a variety of computational device types, including CPUs and GPUs. libCEED provides a low-level Application Programming Interface (API) for users, where they describe finite element operators and the library coordinates the action of the selected backend to the original operator independently on each device/MPI task. In this talk, we investigate the performance of high-order finite element implementation on different CPU and GPU architectures, along with $p$-multigrid preconditioning for our 3D hyperelastic models using unstructured mesh and polynomials of order $p=1$ through $p=4$.</p></div></td></tr></table></div><div class="session"><a name="session:58822"><div class="heading"><span class="interval">11:25-13:30</span> <span class="title">Session 10C: Iterative Solvers in Applications</span></div></a><div class="session_chair"><div class="chair_word">Chair: </div><div class="chair_names"><a href="person93.html" class="person">Philipp Birken</a></div></div><table class="talks"><tr class="talk"><td class="time">11:25</td><td><a name="talk:187905"><div class="authors"><a href="person192.html" class="person">Philipp Birken</a>, <a href="person193.html" class="person">Peter Meisrimel</a> and <a class="person" href="person194.html">Azahar Monge</a></div></a><div class="title">Waveform iterations for thermal coupling</div><div class="presenter">PRESENTER: <a href="person192.html" class="person">Philipp Birken</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT.

Then, the nonlinear PDE is recast into a sequence of linearised ones, and the quantities leading to the solution at each point of the interface on each linearised iterate can be computed nearly embarrassingly in parallel by Monte Carlo, thus suiting the trend of modern supercomputer architectures towards GPU-accelerated cores. Another point of PDDSparse is that diffusions departing from an interface are confined to a few subdomains, dramatically shortening their mean exit times; and allowing PDDSparse to efficiently distribute the PDE data among the nodes.

The scattering problems (in electromagnetics, acoustics, geophysics etc.) follow the time-harmonic Helmholtz equation, which on reformulating in volume integral form results in the Lippmann Schwinger equation. The discretization of the Lippmann Schwinger equation results in a dense linear system. It has been established that certain subblocks of the resulting dense linear system are low-rank. Using Hierarchical trees to represent these low-rank blocks reduces the memory and computational effort involved in solving such dense systems. So it is natural to consider these hierarchical low-rank representations to accelerate the mat-vecs involved in Iterative Solvers. One such Hierarchical representation is HODLR(Hierarchically Off-Diagonal Low Rank) Matrices. HODLR matrices consider all the off-
diagonal blocks as low-rank. It works optimally for one-dimension problems, whereas for two dimensions problems, the rank of the off-diagonal blocks in-

Mutual interactions in multi-component systems often lead to emergent phenomena, i.e., system behaviors that cannot be expected by studying the individual components separately. Practical applications, including multi-query simulations, demand accurate and computationally fast methods able to detect such behaviors. This can be achieved through Model Order Reduction (MOR) techniques. However, in many cases, simulations of the fully coupled model are unfeasible. The coupling functions may not be a-priori available, physical or numerical incompatibilities among the components may be present, or the computational cost of the coupled problem is too large.

In the offline phase we construct the local models by suitably parametrizing the interface data, while in the online phase we combine them through domain decomposition techniques.

There are several ways of obtaining such approximations depending on the type of matrix involved. For kernel matrices, analytic approximation methods have been used in the Fast Multipole Method and other hierarchical matrix algorithms. In this talk, we focus on the proxy point method, in which pairwise interactions between two separated clusters are approximated using the interactions of each cluster with a smaller chosen set of "proxy" points that separate the clusters. One disadvantage of the proxy point method is uncertainty about which and how many proxy points are necessary to obtain a given approximation accuracy: existing analysis is highly context-dependent, especially in the case of kernel functions of more than one real variable.
