The generalized minimum residual method (GMRES) has a rich body of convergence theory related to the spectrum and normality of the coefficient matrix. In preconditioning, GMRES can be used to perform linear solves with the preconditioning matrices (e.g., the incomplete LU factors). Here, the GMRES polynomial must be fixed between preconditioning iterations. In this case, the convergence of GMRES can have strong dependence on the right-hand-side vector.

We consider Anderson acceleration (AA) with a moving window of size m, and investigate the linear asymptotic convergence behaviour of AA(m) applied to linear and nonlinear fixed-point methods. Anderson acceleration has been shown empirically to be very effective for accelerating nonlinear solvers and optimization methods, with broad applications in computational science, data analysis and machine learning, but there is no theory to explain and quantify the asymptotic convergence improvement that is observed in practice.</p><p>We first observe numerically that the root-linear convergence factor of sequences generated by AA(m) strongly depends on the initial condition, and that the acceleration coefficients oscillate while the approximation converges to the fixed point. To shed light on this behaviour, we write AA(m) itself as an augmented fixed-point method and establish that the iteration function of the AA(m) fixed-point iteration is not differentiable at the fixed point (but the directional derivatives exist). This allows the root-linear convergence factor to be strongly dependent on the initial guess. We also find that the acceleration coefficient function is not continuous, thus allowing the coefficients to oscillate while the approximation converges. </p><p>To further investigate AA(m) convergence, we consider the case of accelerating linear fixed-point methods and write AA(m) with the usual recursive initial guess process as a Krylov space method. We obtain polynomial residual update formulas for AA(m) and derive an (m+2)-term recurrence relation for the AA(m) polynomials. A direct consequence is that k steps of AA(m) cannot produce a residual that is smaller in the 2-norm than the residual obtained by GMRES(k). AA(m) with m arbitrary initial guesses is a multi-Krylov space method. The recurrence relations also reveal that AA(m) possesses a memory effect: as a result of the windowing in AA(m), the damping effect provided by fixed-point iterations accumulates multiplicatively (contrary to the case of restarted GMRES(m)), and is combined with polynomial acceleration to lead to effective convergence. We further derive orthogonality relations for the AA(m) residuals, and for AA(1) we find a lower bound for the acceleration coefficient. Results are also obtained for the influence of the initial guess on the convergence speed of AA(1).</p><p>While these results reveal many interesting findings about asymptotic convergence of AA(m), the main question to quantify the asymptotic  convergence acceleration provided by AA(m) remains an open problem. Specifically, we now know numerically that the root-linear convergence factor of sequences generated by AA(m) strongly depends on the initial condition and for many problems the worst-case convergence factor over all initial guesses is much smaller than the convergence factor of the initial fixed-point method, but we don't know how to compute this worst-case convergence factor.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">10:15</td><td><a name="talk:187975"><div class="authors"><a href="person33.html" class="person">Bulat Valiakhmetov</a> and <a href="person34.html" class="person">Dmitry Zheltkov</a></div></a><div class="title">GCR equivalent multiple right-hand side GMRES</div><div class="presenter">PRESENTER: <a class="person" href="person33.html">Bulat Valiakhmetov</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT.

The GMRES algorithm of Saad and Schultz (1986) for nonsymmetric linear systems relies on the Arnoldi expansion of the Krylov basis. The algorithm computes the $QR$ factorization of the matrix $B = [\: r_0, AV_m\:]$. Despite an ${\cal O}(\eps)\kappa(B)$ loss of orthogonality, the modified Gram-Schmidt (MGS) formulation was shown to be backward stable in the seminal papers by Paige, Rozlo{\v{z}}n{\'{\i}}k and Strako\v{s} (2006) and Paige and Strako\v{s} (2002). Classical Gram-Schmidt (CGS) exhibits an ${\cal O}(\eps)\kappa^2(B)$ loss of orthogonality, whereas CGS-2 (CGS with reorthogonalization) reduces this to ${\cal O}(\eps)$. We present a post-modern (viz not classical) GMRES based on Ruhe (1983) and the low-synch one-reduce algorithms of Swirydowicz et al (2020) that achieves ${\cal O}(\eps)\kappa^{1/p}(B)$ loss of orthogonality, $p = -log \rho$, where $rho$ is the spectral radius of $(I + L)^{-1}L^T$, $V^TV = I + L + L^T$. For a broad, class of matrices, unlike MGS-GMRES, loss of orthogonality does not occur and the relative residual no longer stalls for highly non-normal systems. The Krylov vectors remain linearly independent and the smallest singular value of $V_k$ is one. We also demonstrate that Henrici's departure from normality of the triangular correction matrix $T$ in the Gram-Schmidt projector $P = I - V_kTv_k^T$ is an appropriate metric for detecting the loss of orthogonality.</p></div></td></tr></table></div><div class="session"><a name="session:58799"><div class="heading"><span class="interval">09:00-11:05</span> <span class="title">Session 3B: Scalable Solvers for Coupled Multiphysics 1</span></div></a><div class="session_chair"><div class="chair_word">Chair: </div><div class="chair_names"><a href="person164.html" class="person">Luis Chacon</a></div></div><table class="talks"><tr class="talk"><td class="time">09:00</td><td><a name="talk:187917"><div class="authors"><a class="person" href="person163.html">Qi Tang</a>, <a href="person164.html" class="person">Luis Chacon</a>, <a class="person" href="person165.html">Tzanio Kolev</a>, <a class="person" href="person149.html">John Shadid</a> and <a class="person" href="person166.html">Xian-Zhu Tang</a></div></a><div class="title">An adaptive scalable fully implicit algorithm based on stabilized finite element for reduced visco-resistive MHD</div><div class="presenter">PRESENTER: <a class="person" href="person163.html">Qi Tang</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. The magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations are continuum models used in the study of a wide range of plasma physics systems, including the evolution of complex plasma dynamics in tokamak disruptions. However, efficient numerical solution methods for MHD are extremely challenging due to disparate time and length scales, strong hyperbolic phenomena, and nonlinearity. Therefore the development of scalable, implicit MHD algorithms and high-resolution adaptive mesh refinement strategies is of considerable importance. In this work, we develop a high-order stabilized finite-element algorithm for the reduced visco-resistive MHD equations based on the MFEM finite element library (mfem.org). The scheme is fully implicit, solved with the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) method with a physics-based preconditioning strategy. Our preconditioning strategy is a generalization of the physics-based preconditioning methods in [Chac ́on, et al, JCP 2002] to adaptive, stabilized finite elements. Algebraic multigrid methods are used to invert sub-block operators to achieve scalability. A parallel adaptive mesh refinement scheme with dynamic load-balancing is implemented to efficiently resolve the multi-scale spatial features of the system. Our implementation uses the MFEM framework, which provides arbitrary-order polynomials and flexible adaptive conforming and non- conforming meshes capabilities. Results demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and scalability of the implicit scheme in the presence of large scale disparity. The potential of the AMR approach is demonstrated on an island coalescence problem in the high Lundquist-number regime (&gt;=1e7) with the successful resolution of plasmoid instabilities and thin current sheets.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">09:25</td><td><a name="talk:187971"><div class="authors"><a href="person36.html" class="person">Patrick Farrell</a>, <a href="person39.html" class="person">Fabian Laakmann</a> and <a href="person40.html" class="person">Lawrence Mitchell</a></div></a><div class="title">Augmented Lagrangian preconditioners for incompressible resistive magnetohydrodynamics</div><div class="presenter">PRESENTER: <a class="person" href="person36.html">Patrick Farrell</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT.

Radiation-hydrodynamics (rad-hydro) is insufficient to describe accurately weakly collisional environments in high-energy-density physics (HEDP) experiments. These environments are common, for instance, in the hohlraum in inertial confinement fusion (ICF) indirectly-driven experiments, which is a key component of the energy delivery system to the capsule that controls, for instance, implosion symmetry.

Inverse problems are ubiquitous in many scientific fields such as engineering, biology, medical imaging, atmospheric science, and geophysics. Three emerging challenges on obtaining meaningful solutions to large-scale and data-intensive inverse problems are ill-posedness of the problem, large dimensionality of the parameters, and the complexity of the model constraints. In this talk we discuss efficient methods for computing solutions to dynamic inverse problems, where both the quantities of interest and the forward operator (measurement process) may change at different time instances. We consider large-scale ill-posed problems that are made more challenging by their dynamic nature and, possibly, by the limited amount of available data per measurement step.
To remedy these difficulties, we apply efficient regularization methods that enforce simultaneous regularization in space and time (such as edge enhancement at each time instant and proximity at consecutive time instants) and achieve this with low computational cost and enhanced accuracy. Numerical examples from a wide range of applications, such as limited-angle computerized tomography (CT), space-time image deblurring, and photoacoustic tomography (PAT), will be used to illustrate the effectiveness of the described approaches.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">09:25</td><td><a name="talk:187984"><div class="authors"><a href="person16.html" class="person">Malena Espanol</a> and <a class="person" href="person17.html">Mirjeta Pasha</a></div></a><div class="title">An ℓp Variable Projection Method for Large-Scale Separable Nonlinear Inverse Problems</div><div class="presenter">PRESENTER: <a href="person16.html" class="person">Malena Espanol</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT.

In this work, we develop hybrid projection methods for computing solutions to large-scale inverse problems, where the solution represents a sum of  different stochastic components. Such scenarios arise in many imaging applications (e.g., anomaly detection in atmospheric emissions tomography) where the reconstructed image can be represented as a combination of two or more images and each image contains different smoothness or stochastic properties.  In an inversion or inverse modeling framework, these assumptions correspond to different regularization terms for each image in the sum. Although various prior assumptions can be included in our framework, we focus on the scenario where the solution is a sum of a sparse image and a smooth image; thus, we require $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ regularization for separate components, respectively. For computing solution estimates, we develop hybrid projection methods for solution decomposition that are based on a combined flexible and generalized Golub-Kahan process. This approach integrates techniques from the generalized Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization and the flexible Krylov methods. The benefits of the proposed methods are that the decomposition of the solution can be done iteratively, and the regularization terms and regularization parameters are adaptively chosen at each iteration.

We compare the method with a column generation approach where the basis vectors of the subspace are selected based on the steepest descent direction that is orthogonal to the current subpace.

Over the past decade, the proliferation of smart devices ranging from residential smart thermostats to industrial smart power grid meters has motivated research into migrating scientific computing from high-performance computing (HPC) and cloud computing (CC) to these devices. Computing on these smart devices, also referred to as edge devices, allows for computation on data in-situ, avoiding the need to aggregate that data to HPC and/or CC facilities for processing. One bottleneck of this migration is that the same fault tolerance approaches that provide reliable results on HPC and CC systems do not necessarily apply to edge computing environments. As an example, consider checkpoint and restart functionality is a standard approach for mitigating the disruption of an HPC or CC node failing.  Such an approach is not feasible for many edge computing environments where data storage is more limited and synchronization more costly than with the massive file systems and high-speed interconnects in HPC and CC systems.

Decentralized computing environments (DCE), or environments, such as edge computing, which utilize spatially distributed, non-hierarchical, and potentially heterogeneous computational units, present additional challenges such as communication delays and data locality which require asynchronous and resilient iterative methods to be practical. Such algorithms must be capable of progressing toward a solution even if one or more computational units is experiencing slowdowns, either due to poor communication connections or under-performing hardware. Previous work has shown that these challenges can be overcome for stationary iterative methods, such as asynchronous Jacobi (ASJ). In high-performance computing (HPC) settings, Krylov subspace iterative solvers, such as the conjugate gradient method (CG), are preferred for solving linear systems with symmetric positive-definite matrices due to their strong convergence guarantees. Despite requiring synchronous communication across all processors at every iteration, CG performs exceptionally well in shared memory and HPC environments. In DCE, the communication costs of synchronization may be considerably higher, as delays from even one computational unit prevent any other units from continuing. Further, the connection speeds between devices in edge computing will be considerable slower than the high-speed interconnects found in the HPC setting. We have developed an asynchronous CG (ACG) algorithm which removes these synchronization points by utilizing the partial direction vectors received at each iteration to form the next, mutually orthogonal search direction. Initial numerical results demonstrate the number of iterations required for convergence scales with the square root of the condition number of the matrix, as in the traditional CG algorithm. Further, we will present numerical results which compare ACG to CG and ASJ in both reliable computing environments and with injected delays and corruption to demonstrate the algorithmic performance of each for different computing environments.</p><p>Prepared by LLNL under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.

One approach to improving the performance of stationary linear solvers is to utilize asynchronous communication between the processors. In order to establish bounds on convergence rate, randomized various of asynchronous linear solvers have been studied. This approach has been examined previously for the case where the random selection is done uniformly [1, 5]. A non-uniform random selection has been used for the case of synchronous algorithms [2, 3], however in both studies the distribution remains fixed and does not dynamically change. The idea behind the solvers considered here is for each processor to select the next component to update randomly, using a distribution that more heavily weights selection of components that are somehow more important to the solution. The main contribution is to analyze the potential performance benefit for using a non-uniform distribution, to evaluate the viability of changing the update order dynamically, and to investigate methods for ranking the contribution of each component.</p><p>This updating procedure is motivated in part by the Southwell iteration, which selects the component with the largest contribution to the residual at each iteration and which can converge in fewer iterations than traditional relaxation schemes; previous work has also shown that Southwell type iterations can converge faster than uniform random selection [4]. There is a balance between the extra computational time required to intelligently select components, and the savings in total iterations. Updating all the residuals every iteration likely introduces too much computational overhead to be of practical use, and techniques are explored for lessening this computational burden. The thrust of the new algorithms is to focus on techniques that achieve this dynamic focus on components that contribute more to the residual but do so in an efficient manner.</p><p>[1] Haim Avron, Alex Druinsky, and Anshul Gupta.

We introduce a new electrostatic particle-in-cell algorithm capable of using large timesteps compared to particle gyro-period under a (to begin, uniform) large external magnetic field. The algorithm extends earlier electrostatic fully implicit PIC implementations [1] with a new asymptotic-preserving (AP) particle-push scheme [2] that allows timesteps much larger than particle gyro-periods. In the large-timestep limit, the AP integrator preserves all the averaged particle drifts, while recovering the standard CN scheme for small timesteps, while recovering particle full orbits with small timesteps. The scheme allows for a seamless, efficient treatment of particles in coexisting magnetized and unmagnetized regions, conserves energy and charge exactly, and does not spoil implicit solver performance. Key to the approach is the generalization of the particle sub-stepping approach introduced in Ref. [1] to allow for orbit segments much larger than cell sizes without spoiling conservation properties. The uniform-magnetic-field assumption allows us to use the standard CN update in Ref. [1] without modification, which is a necessary preliminary step to demonstrate the viability of the approach for more general magnetic field topologies (which will require the implementation in Ref. [2], currently underway). We demonstrate by numerical experiment with several strongly magnetized problems (e.g., diocotron instability, modified two-stream instability, drift instability, etc.) that two orders of magnitude wall-clock-time speedups are possible vs. the standard fully implicit electrostatic PIC algorithm [1] without sacrificing solution quality and while preserving strict charge and energy conservation.

We describe the block preconditioning approach used in our COGENT code, whose primary application is the simulation of the edge plasma region of tokamak fusion reactors.  The underlying model is a continuum gyrokinetic system describing the evolution of plasma species distribution functions in 4D axisymmetric or 5D phase space, where the configuration space geometry includes open and closed field line regions spanning the magnetic separatrix and X-point.  COGENT combines a high-order, finite-volume, mapped-multiblock spatial discretization with an additive Runge-Kutta (ARK) time integrator to advance the distribution functions, fluid and neutral species moments, and an electrostatic potential, all with a variety of collision operators.  Central to the ARK approach is the identification of fast time-scales to be included in the implicit component of the fully coupled system, which is advanced consistently with the slower explicit terms to a specified temporal accuracy.  Updates of the implicit ARK stages require the solution of nonlinear systems, for which COGENT employs a Newton-Krylov algorithm.  Block preconditioners are employed to accelerate the Krylov iteration, where the blocks approximate the operators responsible for the various fast time scales being treated implicitly.  In addition to disjoint operators resulting in diagonal preconditioner blocks, the framework anticipates the possible overlap of implicit terms, coordinating the construction of linear systems and their solution using multigrid solvers provided by the Hypre library.

Efficient coupling of the microscopic physics into the macroscopic system-scale dynamics (called "fluid-kinetic" coupling) is probably the most important and unresolved problem of computational plasma physics. It impacts most of plasma physics areas including space physics and fusion systems. Majority of conventional simulation tools capable of describing large scale dynamics are usually limited to simplified fluid/magnetohydrodynamics description of the plasma, because of the large spatial and temporal scale separation typical of plasmas. Yet, fluid models lack the microscopic physics, which is known to be important in many applications (e.g., reconnection, shock physics, etc.) A way forward is to build models that combine kinetic and fluid description in one consistent framework. The development of such methods can bridge the scale gap to successfully handle coupling of large-scale dynamics and microscopic processes.</p><p>In this presentation, we describe a novel simulation method, where the kinetic equation is solved using a spectral expansion of the plasma distribution function. The low-order terms in the expansion capture the large-scale dynamics of the system, while higher-order terms add microscopic physics incrementally, similar to classical fluid-moment expansion. Such a method is ideally suited for problems involving fluid-kinetic coupling, since the number of expansion terms could be adapted in space and time. Furthermore, the spectral basis itself adaptively changes in space and time, adjusting to plasma mean flow and temperature, thus making the representation of the particle distribution function very efficient. We show that our reduced kinetic model with just a ~(4-6)^3 velocity-space moments agrees well with results from fully-kinetic simulations on some examples.

In the field of reservoir engineering one of the primary time-consuming steps is process of history matching to update the mathematical models describing fluid flow in the subsurface reservoir to match the existing historical production data more closely. This task usually involves either data assimilation or the repeated tuning of parameters through numerous simulations (Oliver 2011). Bayesian Optimization has not yet seen much use in the petroleum industry and is a useful approach to optimization that allows finding an optimal set of parameters for cost functions that are especially expensive (Brochu 2010). This ability to optimize cost functions that may take extensive run time may be very well suited to the task of history matching reservoir models.
In this study a framework has been developed to assist with the evaluation of Bayesian Optimization for the task of history matching relative permeability curves. This framework was designed to enable testing on both local and remote machines with a range of capabilities from desktop workstations to large scale clusters. Simulations are conducted utilizing the Reservoir Simulation Group parallel black oil simulator (Wang 2015). This simulator is designed to run on distributed memory computers and utilizes the finite difference method for discretization of the black oil model. At each timestep in the simulation, the simulator utilizes the inexact Newton method to approximately solve the linearized form of the nonlinear systems in the black oil model (Wang 2015). The coupling between the unknowns in the system (pressure and saturation/bubble point pressure) needs to first be weakened through the application of a multi-stage preconditioner (Wang 2015). The preconditioner chosen for this study is the constrained pressure residual (CPR) method that separates the pressure block from the full system and utilizes the algebraic multigrid solver (AMG) to solve the pressure block before utilizing a global smoother applied to the full system (Wang 2015, Wallis 1985, Cao 2005). The restarted general minimal residual method (GMRES) is then used to find the solution to the linear system (Wang 2015, Saad 2003). This whole process is repeated for the next timestep in the simulation until a stopping condition is met. 
When conducting history matching of a reservoir model, a search of possible parameters is conducted to find the best possible fit. This task typically involves either the iterative assimilation of data during a simulation or the repeated tuning and re-running of simulations until an appropriate match is found (Oliver 2011). Bayesian Optimization has been chosen for this study due to its suitability for optimization of the extremely long running simulations required in reservoir simulation. Bayesian Optimization utilizes Bayes theorem to determine the likelihood of an output based on prior knowledge of the cost function. Several sets of initial parameters are chosen and then the costs are found by running a simulation with each set of parameters. Based on this newly found knowledge of the cost function the Bayesian Optimization algorithm will use an acquisition function to choose a new set of parameters that are expected to provide an improvement. At this stage the optimization process can be configured to be more exploratory in selecting parameters to avoid local minimums or more exploitative to conduct a more directed search of the parameter space. Multiple iterations of this process are conducted until a stopping condition is met (Brochu 2010). For the cost function the fluid production and injection rate curves for the water, oil, gas, and injected fluids are compared against the production data curves using FastDTW (Salvador 2007). The distances between the test and production curves are combined using the Euclidean norm to find the cost of the current set of parameters. At the end of the optimization process, the parameters with the minimum cost are chosen as the optimal parameter set. Due to the randomness in selecting new parameters the average number of required epochs for the optimization is found through repeated runs of the entire process.
The SPE 9 black oil model has been utilized for the initial development in this study as a test and benchmark model due to its reasonable complexity but still manageable simulation time (Killough 1995). To simulate the real-world task of history matching, the standard SPE 9 model is set as the “real” production data. For the remainder of the study the relative permeability curves are assumed to be unknown and history matching will be conducted to determine these curves. To aid the process of history matching the relative permeability curves are reduced to a smaller set of 10 parameters with the application of Stone’s Model II (Reynolds 2004). In this model the curves are parameterized to an approximate analytical form that closely matches the values of the relative permeability curves (Reynolds 2004). 
Current early results are showing promising behavior to find the optimal parameters, however further work is in progress to finalize the experiments. We have begun to evaluate the performance of this Bayesian Optimization framework on larger scale models that require a significant amount of simulation time (on the order of days/weeks on standard workstations or hours on large-scale computation resources). Due to the expensive time cost of these simulations, it is expected the Bayesian Optimization framework will show benefits over more traditional approaches such as the Ensemble Kalman Filter (ENKF) method (Lorentzen 2001, Aanonsen 2009). A full comparison between the Bayesian Optimization history matching framework and the ENKF method will need to be conducted.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">13:05</td><td><a name="talk:187881"><div class="authors"><a href="person246.html" class="person">Andrei Draganescu</a> and <a class="person" href="person247.html">Harbir Antil</a></div></a><div class="title">Multigrid preconditioning for distributed optimal control of fractional parabolic equations</div><div class="presenter">PRESENTER: <a href="person246.html" class="person">Andrei Draganescu</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. Optimal control problems constrained by fractional parabolic operators have attracted a lot of attention over the last couple of years. Such problems arise naturally in optimal control of anomalous diffusion and in machine learning. While solving fractional parabolic equations poses significant challenges on its own, having them appear as constraints in an optimization problem increases the complexity dramatically, further limiting the size of the problems that can be solved in practice.</p><p>In general there are two approaches for solving optimal control problems constrained by PDEs, namely the all-at-once pathway, and the reduced-type methods.  In the all-at-once approach one has to solve the KKT system representing the first order optimality conditions. The main advantage lies in the fact that for PDE constraints this system is sparse, and no PDE solves are necessary during the process, as the PDE and its adjoint equation are solved as a coupled system. Several works favor this approach for classical parabolic control. However, for fractional parabolic control, the KKT system is no longer sparse, and we prefer the reduced approach using the control-to-state map.  Building on our earlier work on multigrid preconditioning for classical parabolic control and on fractional elliptic control, we show how multigrid can be used to solve fractional parabolic control problems very efficiently. A partial analysis and numerical results support our claim.</p></div></td></tr></table></div><div class="session"><div class="coffeebreak"><span class="interval">13:30-14:00</span><span class="title">End of Day Break</span></div></div></div>
